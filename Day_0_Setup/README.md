# Pre-Bootcamp Preparation
Welcome to the 2024 MSTP Bioinformatics Bootcamp! 

We want to cover as much material as possible for during the actual bootcamp. To make sure we can do that, you'll need to do some set-up before the bootcamp starts.

## 1. Windows Users: Install Linux on Windows
    - If you are working from a laptop that runs a Windows operating system, you will need to install a Linux distribution. We recommend installing the Ubuntu Linux distribution: 1_LinuxOnWindows.ipynb. **Mac and Linux users can skip this step.**

## 2. Log in to Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC)
    - Next, you will need to make sure you can log in to Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC) where we will be running most of our analyses during the bootcamp: 2_TSCC.ipynb

## 3. Install Software
    - Finally, you will need to install the following software on your local machine: Installations.ipynb

If you run into any issues or have any questions/concerns feel free to shoot me an email: aklie@ucsd.edu
