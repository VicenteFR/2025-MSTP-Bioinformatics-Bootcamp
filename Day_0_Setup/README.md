# Pre-Bootcamp Preparation
Welcome to the 2024 MSTP Bioinformatics Bootcamp! 

To make sure we don't spend the whole first day troubleshooting, we will to do some set-up before the bootcamp starts.

## 1. Windows Users: Install Linux on Windows
- If you are working from a laptop that runs a Windows operating system, you will need to install a Linux distribution. Instructions for installing the Ubuntu Linux distribution can be found in 1_LinuxOnWindows.md. **Mac and Linux users can skip this step.**

## 2. Log in to Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC)
- Next, you will need to make sure you can log in to Triton Shared Computing Cluster (TSCC) where we will be running most of our analyses during the bootcamp: 2_TSCC.md

## 3. Install Software
- Finally, you will need to install several programs: Installations.md

If you run into any issues or have any questions/concerns feel free to shoot me an email: aklie@ucsd.edu
